## Motivation
This website was created to advertise a soccer camp for kids in suncroft, co. Kildare. It's goal is to encourage parents to sign up there kids to our soccer camps.My motivation for this project is based on my own involvement with training kids from a young age. When i was growing up there was no such facilities or programs in place. I want to create something to give all children a great chance to develop there football abilities from a young age and to make new friends. I have found it is a great way to help them develop both physically and mentally.

## Design

### Colour Scheme

The below image was taken from the website colorhexa.com and it is an eaxample of the main colour displayed in this site. The original colour picked was a light green colour with a value of #ccf381. This colour was chosen in place of #ccf381 as it is considered a web safe colour as shown in colorhexa.com. 
The other colours displayed on the site are whitesmoke and black. The whitesmoke colour was chosen for the purpose of emphasising the foreground display. Black was used for all font colours with red used for all hover actions.

* Roboto was used for the headings on the site. It is a Sans-Serif font. The back up font selected was San-Serif.

* Lato was used for the body of the site. It is also a Sans-Serif font. The back up Font selected was Sans-Serif.

### Imagery

All imagery was used with the permission of their owners. I have credited all of these in the Credits section of this README.md File.


### Site Layout

The website consists of three seperate pages with a home page extended into sections. All pages are accessible from the navbar at the top of the pages. 

## All Pages:

All pages on this website have a reponsive navigation bar at the top. The navigation bar is located on the right of the page opposite the main header. It is diplayed horizontally across the header. The navigation bar displays vertical with disks on mobile screen sizes. The main logo in displayed on the left on all pages. It is displayed horizontally but the words stack on top of one another on mobile devices to allow sapce in the main header and avoid cluttering.
The footer is displayed on all pages and it does not change its layout. It was made responvie throught he use of Flex elements. The social media icons on the footer narrow in width but maintain an equal space as the page gets smaller. The wording for each social media icon will move underneath the icons when the page width reaches 487px.

* Home Page.

- Main Image Section: The main image shows kids playing football in front of goalposts. It is intended to highlight the age profile of kids that can attend the summer camp to attract all age groups that are within the age brackets. There is a text circle within the image highlighting the age requirements. There is a bar containing text underneath the main image. This is a quote from a famous sports person intended to encourage signing up.

- About Us Section: The about us section consists of two parts which are layed out horizontally on larger screens and on smaller screen sizes, the image will move underneath the text. The text displays on the left and gives the essential information about the summer camp with contact details for any further queries. The image is of a football sitting in the middle of a football field.

- Google map section: The Google map is displayed at the bottom of the screen above the footer. It is an interactive map that allows users to see where the summer camp will be held.

* Gallery.

- The gallery is a small collection of images from previous camps. Its purpose is to give the viewer a better understanding of what the camp entails. The images will display in two columns on larger screens and in a vertical column on tablet and mobile devices.

* Sign Up:

- The sign up page is a single page with a background image of a football net and a football. The foreground features a sign up form which asks the user for their information ,the childs information and an E-mail address.


### Accessibility

I have been conscientious of achieving the maximum amoun of accessibility possible by completing the following actions:

* Using semantic HTML.

* Using alt attribute with images on the site. There are two exceptions to the use of alt attributes. The first is the main image on  the home page which has a text circle inserted to assist screen readers and the background image on the sign up page which is there for background decorative purposes.

* Ensuring sufficent colour contrast throughout the site

* Adding text to the social media elements on the footer to assist screen readers.


### Technologies Implemented

* HTML and CSS - To create this website.

* Git - For version control

* Github - To save and store the files for the website construction.

* Google Fonts - To import the fonts used on the website.

* Font awesome - To create the social media icons on the footer.

* Google dev tools - To troubleshoot and test features and to monitor and adjudt the website to ensure it is responsive.

* Tiny PNG - To compress images

* Am I Responsive? - To show the website image on a range of devices.


### Testing

Testing was an ongoing process from the start to the finish of the build. I used a chrome developer tools to assist me in solving problems as i progressed through the project.

I encountered the following build issues and bugs as i progressed through the project.

* The main image would not conform to my intended page size. At this point in the project I was using float elements to align my page. I then learned how to use flex properties and when I used flex properties I was able to align the main image.

* The image in the about us section on the home page was creating a white margin on the right of the page when screen width reached 487px. I identified this issue using chrome developer tools. I applied an overflow value of hidden to the relevant media query to prevent this form happening.

* The lighthouse test on developer tools is displaying a score of 82 for performance. I discussed this with my mentor and the possible explanation for this and reached a conclusion which i discuss in the lighthouse section later in the page.

* The form name element in the input id for parent did not have sufficient indiviual detail as pointed out by my mentor. This was causing a problem when submittimg the form as there are two submission fields for parent/guardian and child.
